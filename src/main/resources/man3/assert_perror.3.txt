ASSERT_PERROR(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual          ASSERT_PERROR(3)



NAME
       assert_perror - test errnum and abort

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <assert.h>

       void assert_perror(int errnum);

DESCRIPTION
       If  the  macro  NDEBUG  was  defined  at the moment <assert.h> was last
       included, the macro assert_perror() generates no code, and  hence  does
       nothing  at  all.  Otherwise, the macro assert_perror() prints an error
       message to  standard  error  and  terminates  the  program  by  calling
       abort(3)  if  errnum  is  nonzero.   The message contains the filename,
       function name and line number of the macro call, and the output of str‐
       error(errnum).

RETURN VALUE
       No value is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       This is a GNU extension.

BUGS
       The purpose of the assert macros is to help the programmer find bugs in
       his program, things that cannot happen unless there was a  coding  mis‐
       take.   However,  with  system or library calls the situation is rather
       different, and error returns can happen, and will happen, and should be
       tested  for.  Not by an assert, where the test goes away when NDEBUG is
       defined, but by proper error handling code.  Never use this macro.
