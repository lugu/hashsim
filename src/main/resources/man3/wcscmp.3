The
.BR wcscmp ()
function returns zero if the wide-character strings at
\fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP are equal.
It returns an integer greater than zero if
at the first differing position \fIi\fP, the corresponding wide-character
\fIs1[i]\fP is greater than \fIs2[i]\fP.
It returns an integer less than zero if
