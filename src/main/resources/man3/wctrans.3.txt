WCTRANS(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCTRANS(3)



NAME
       wctrans - wide-character translation mapping

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctrans_t wctrans(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wctrans_t type represents a mapping which can map a wide character
       to another wide character.  Its nature is implementation-dependent, but
       the  special  value  (wctrans_t) 0 denotes an invalid mapping.  Nonzero
       wctrans_t values can be passed to the towctrans(3) function to actually
       perform the wide-character mapping.

       The  wctrans()  function returns a mapping, given by its name.  The set
       of valid names depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current  locale,
       but the following names are valid in all locales.
         "tolower" - realizes the tolower(3) mapping
         "toupper" - realizes the toupper(3) mapping

RETURN VALUE
       The  wctrans()  function  returns  a  mapping descriptor if the name is
       valid.  Otherwise it returns (wctrans_t) 0.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wctrans() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the  cur‚Äê
       rent locale.
