.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcsspn ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR strspn (3)
function.
It determines the length of the longest initial segment of \fIwcs\fP
which consists entirely of wide-characters listed in \fIaccept\fP.
In other
words, it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-character string
\fIwcs\fP of a wide-character not contained in the wide-character string
\fIaccept\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR wcsspn ()
function returns the number of
wide characters in the longest
initial segment of \fIwcs\fP which consists entirely of wide-characters listed
in \fIaccept\fP.
In other words, it returns the position of the first
occurrence in the wide-character string \fIwcs\fP of a wide-character not
contained in the wide-character string \fIaccept\fP, or \fIwcslen(wcs)\fP
if there is none.
