NAME
       localeconv - get numeric formatting information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <locale.h>

       struct lconv *localeconv(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  localeconv()  function returns a pointer to a struct lconv for the
       current locale.  This structure is shown in locale(7), and contains all
       values  associated  with  the locale categories LC_NUMERIC and LC_MONE‐
       TARY.  Programs may also use the functions  printf(3)  and  strfmon(3),
       which behave according to the actual locale in use.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99.

BUGS
       The  printf(3)  family  of  functions  may or may not honor the current
       locale.
