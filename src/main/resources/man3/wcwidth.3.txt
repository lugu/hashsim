WCWIDTH(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                WCWIDTH(3)



NAME
       wcwidth - determine columns needed for a wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcwidth(wchar_t c);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcwidth()  function returns the number of columns needed to repre‐
       sent the wide character c.  If c is a  printable  wide  character,  the
       value is at least 0.  If c is null wide character (L'\0'), the value is
       0.  Otherwise -1 is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcwidth() function returns the number of column positions for c.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

       Note that glibc before 2.2.5 used the prototype
       int wcwidth(wint_t c);

NOTES
       The behavior of wcwidth() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the  cur‐
       rent locale.
